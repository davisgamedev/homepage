The astronaut is represented by a piano, since it\u2019s a familiar instrument in Western music so it should be easy to attach that idea to the astronaut and make him more empathetic to the audience. I also used windchimes to represent the sense of wonder/ethereality of space, and then later added synths to represent adventure and discovery. For the planet environments it was pretty straightforward.

Instead I decided it was best to represent them with just the instruments I had chosen. With the astronaut I had picked a piano, so the otter needed to be something complimentary but different, and more unfamiliar. As a percussionist I absolutely love the lamellophone family, so I chose a Kalimba. These two work really well together as they can both share a similar range and both share a percussive character, but with a contrasting timbre. For the characters first interaction, I had the otter play a variation of the adventure theme, with the piano eventually "learning" the same melody, and adding accompaniment.
