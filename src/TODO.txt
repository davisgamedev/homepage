- react memory leak error on console concerning small header, not sure how to replicate
    - because of UseEffect not returning cleanupfunctions, do this.

- small nav off navigation to the right doesn't collapse
- small nav should be full width, or adjusted to size, it's awkward and off center
- small nav location is off center

- blur effect css over all of section, increase large margins for 'windows'
    - doing this on section reduces rendering layers
    - can also do with a webgl shader
